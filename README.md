After two amazing years at McKinsey, I've gained valuable experience in the IT field, where it lead me to become a GHD Analyst.
I've honed my skills in areas such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, network, MS Office package, etc. All this while focused on providing outstanding customer service.
As an student with a passion for cybersecurity, I'm excited to explore the fascinating world of cybersecurity and build a strong foundation in the field.

## Objective
I created this portfolio in order to achieve the following goals:

1. Demonstrate my expertise in cybersecurity. This platform will showcase my skills and experience.
2. Present real-world applications.
3. Increase visibility within the cybersecurity community. This portfolio serves as a launchpad to connect with potential employers and collaborators who share my passion for cybersecurity.
